#BetterDevCLI

<H2>Idea</H2>
While I thoroughly enjoy recieving the next issue of betterDev, I never seem to quite get through them all or know where to start. I often find myself looking though all the previous issues trying to find the articles that relate to my current development efforts. I thought it would be cool if I scrape the <a href="https://betterdev.link/issues">issue archive</a> and create a command line interface tool that contains all the different articles. From this CLI you will be able to: 
    
- See articles based off their tag (language,concept,etc)
- Get a random article based off tag
- Mark an article as read
- Get a random article to read when bored

The app will scrape the site every Monday upon release. It will use different css elements to defer between articles, videos, tools as well as existing tags. I would like to incorporate ML into this project to have each scraped article searched for keywords or concepts.
